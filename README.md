I made an app to help regulate my calorie intake. I made this in about a day. i figured if i made the app myself i would be more inclined to use it.

It's a ridiculous app and EXTREMELY scrappy but ive actually used it quite a few times and it has been really effective in helping me manage my diet. The joys of coding!!
